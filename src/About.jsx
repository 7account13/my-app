      <h2>About the Dance of Words</h2>
      <p>
        This is a webpage completely dedicated to publish poetry especially about nature and its innate beauty .
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, we weave stories of joy and despair, 
        In the dance of the ink,<br />
        we find moments to share. 
        Each poem a journey, each line a new flight, 
        <br />
        Guiding us gently through day and through night.
      </p>
      <p>
        So linger a while, let the verses take hold, <br />
        In the warmth of the stanzas, let your spirit unfold. <br />
        For in the rhythm of words, we discover our song, <br />
        In the embrace of the lines, we find where we belong.
      </p>
